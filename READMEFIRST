This file is for me to remember how does these python files work. Because I don't want to revisit my crappy code.

STEP 1
- Configure the file getNotesLinks.py to the correct periods and classes
STEP 2
- Run getPdf.py to download the notes
STEP 3
- Run getPdf2.py to download the exercises

DONE.

They will update the outdated ones.
